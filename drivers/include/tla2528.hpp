 * @brief tla2528 is a gpio expander & adc mux driver
 *
 * tla2528 has 8 pins which can be independently operated as an adc,
 * digital input, and digital out over i2c. The i2c address is configured by
 * resistors connected to the chip There are no options for internal pull up or
 * pull down resistors. The output pins have the option of push-pull or
 * open-drain. When in adc mode there is an option (UNIMPLEMENTED) to increase
 * reading granularity though sampling averaging.
